			<div class="panel">
			<p><b>Login Page Description</b></p>
				<p>When you first navigate to the site, you are met with the login page. You log in using your Lipscomb email and your Lipscomb password, so no registration on this site is required.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Profile</b></p>
				<p>When you log in, on the sidebar it will display your name, confirming that you have logged in using your account.</p>
			<br>

				<p><b>Sidebar</b></p>
					<p>The sidebar contains the name of the admin, a logout button, the Herdr logo, and links for each section on the site.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Sidebar Links</b></p>
					<p>The sidebar has links to the Dashboard, Matches Center, Reports Center, and Help Center. Clicking on these links will take you to the main page of each section.</p>
				<br>
			</div>

				<button class="accordion">Dashboard</button>
				<div class="panel"><br>
				<p><b>Dashboard Description</b></p>
				<p>The dashboard displays a list of new matches and new reports as well as how many there are of each. It is like a notification panel, where you can only view new matches and new reports.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Search</b></p>
				<p>The search bar allows you to search through the alerts on the dashboard based on name or L number. They will still be separated into the matches and reports categories.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Number of Reports/Matches</b></p>
				<p>The number enclosed in parentheses describes how many of which (matches or reports) you have that are not read or checked. Once those matches and reports are checked, then the number decreases. </p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Dashboard Links</b></p>
				<p>The dashboard will always have links to the matches center and the reports center so you can view both checked and unchecked matches/reports. </p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">Matches Center</button>
				<div class="panel"><br>
				<p><b>Matches Center Description</b></p>
				<p>The matches center displays a list of matches (time and the names of the match) from a certain school year initiated by Lipscomb students from the app. There are either buttons or a status next to each match depending on if the match is checked or not. The names are linked, and if you click on them, you can view the profiles for each student. Under the matches for the current school year, you can also view matches archived from past school years.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Search</b></p>
				<p>The search bar allows you to search through the matches based on name or L number. The results page will be displayed the same way as the main page with the search implemented.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>View Profile</b></p>
				<p>To view the profile of each person involved in the match, click on their name. You will then be taken to the person's profile details.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Profile Details</b></p>
				<p>The profile details page will have their profile picture and all the basic required information about the person (Name, Age Class). It will also display how many warnings and suspensions the user has had (see Reports Center for more details). To go back to the matches center, click on "Back to Matches Center."</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Confirm/Deny Buttons</b></p>
				<p>The confirm/deny buttons will always be next to each initiated match in the matches. To confirm/deny a match, just click on the button that corresponds. The match will then be shown as checked and the status of the match will be shown as Confirmed/Denied. (replaces the buttons). If you feel that a match was wrongly confirmed/denied, you can undo the match and the buttons will be back for you to confirm/deny again. However, after 24 hours, the status will stay as confirmed/denied and there will be no more undos. If the match must be changed again after 24 hours, contact the BANZ Admin.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">Reports Center</button>
				<div class="panel"><br>
				<p><b>Reports Center Description</b></p>
				<p>The reports center displays a list of reports (time and the name of the person reported) from a certain school year initiated by an anonymous Lipscomb student from the app. There is either a button where you can view the details of the report or a status next to each report depending on if the report is dealt with or not that is linked. Under the reports for the current school year, you can also view reports archived from past school years.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Search</b></p>
				<p>The search bar allows you to search through the reports based on name or L number. The results page will be displayed the same way as the main page with the search implemented.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>View Report Details</b></p>
				<p>To view the reports of each person involved in the match, click on "View report details" if the report is unchecked, or the status of the report if the report has been dealt with. You will then be taken to the report details.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Report Details</b></p>
				<p>Just like the profile details under the matches center, the report details page will have their profile picture and all the basic required information about the person (Name, Age Class), with one extra category: the status of the user (No action, warned, or suspended), which depends on what is done with the report. It will also display how many warnings and suspensions the user has had previously. Under this will have the details of the report. This includes the reason for report and any additional details. To go back to the matches center, click on "Back to Reports Center."</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Warn/Suspension Buttons</b></p>
				<p>In the report details page, under the profile picture, there is a yellow button where you can warn the user. Next to that button is a red button where you can suspend the user. You are only allowed to do one or the other, not both. If you choose to warn or suspend the user, the status will change from "No action" to "Warned" or "Suspended" on the report details page and will replace the "View Details" button on the main reports page, linked so details can still be viewed. Additionally, on the person's profile, it will reflect that their number of warnings or suspensions has been incremented by 1. A warning or a suspension will also send an automatic e-mail to the person in their Lipscomb mail account. <i>(<b>Note:</b> If you have viewed the details of a report and have felt like the person reported has not done anything that warrants a warning or suspension, you can just leave the report alone and view others. The report will be shown as checked with "No action" as the status.)</i></p>
