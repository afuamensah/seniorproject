# seniorproject
This was the website I created my senior project by the name of Herdr. Herdr is a roommate-finding app for students at Lipscomb University. I focused on the administration side, where admins can accept/deny roommate match requests, and view/take action on student reports.

PHP folder: consists of the php files coded. 13 out of the 18 pages are static webpages used to display the information. dbconnect.php contains information to connect into the database (localhost information is used for this push), SMTP, PHPMailer, Exception, and email-config is used to facilitate sending automated emails.

IMG folder: houses all the images used for the web app, including the logo.

CSS folder: consists of the style.css file, which was coded to style the web app.

JS folder: consists of the function.js file, which was coded to run the help (help.php) page of the web app.
